            <h1 class="center large"><em>Can you revive it?</em></h1>
            <p>
                It's the future. Humanity has irresponsibly depleted most of the Earth's resources, and after the <em>global ecosystem collapsed</em>, Earth became a hostile, inhospitable place. In the ensuing chaos, famine and conflict, most people
                either <em>escaped to space</em> or were left to die along with the planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generations later, space-dwelling nations decide to attempt a last unified effort to make Earth a habitable planet again - the <em>Environmental Restoration Agency</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each region is assigned a single agent to oversee and guide the restoration. It is up to them to <em>explore</em>, prospect, cultivate, clean up and <em>reintroduce greenery</em> in what will come to be known as the largest life saving operation in the
                history of mankind.

            <h1 class="center large">Explore a simulated environment</h1>
            <p>
                The gameplay centers around surviving the hostile environment, and slowly restoring it using plants, machines and careful terraformation. You will face an <em>unbreathable atmosphere</em>, aggressive robotic enemies, and a lack of all resources necessary for life.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these elements are <em>fully simulated</em> - the atmosphere reacts to each tree you plant, the water flows and soaks into the ground. Your own character can only breathe in the areas you restored, and the enemies will avoid those areas.
            </p>

                I don't know what to write here anymore, just go play the game if you want.
